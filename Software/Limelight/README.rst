Limelight is a tool that basically functions as a camera for the robot. Beyond just being able to see, Limelight has many important and useful methods for tracking objects/colors that it can see, and this can lead to a complex chain of commands (i.e searching for a certain color, then driving towards it.) Limelight methods can also track distances (both x and y) as well as angle displacement. All of its methods are documented on https://docs.limelightvision.io/en/latest/
