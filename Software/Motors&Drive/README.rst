Motor Control & Drive
=====================

This section of the wiki is arguably the most important of the sections, and thankfully is also one of the simplest. Motor control and drive are not hard topics, and are rather simple to implement.

When we talk about motor control, we're talking about how our code interacts with the motor controllers which are wired up to the motors. We primarily utilize CTRE motor controllers which are covered `here <CTRE.md>`_. We also use Rev Robotics Motors, however those are far less common and are covered in `this file <RevRobotics.md>`_. CTRE has its own `documentation <https://docs.ctre-phoenix.com/en/latest/index.html>`_ which I'd suggest checking out, and this moreso serves for a basic usage of motors.
