This section is dedicated to the flywheel shooter design. This shooter type is incredibly common across FRC, and has been on our Infinite Recharge and Rapid React robots.

These shooters are pretty simple to setup, but some math knowledge is required to make them work optimally. In order to fully understand what's going on, you should be enrolled/have taken both a physics and calculus class, or be an asian sweat who already knows it.

The majority of the coding is just template based, and you'll probably just end up copying it. You should know how to tune the PID using last section's guide on it.

The formulas for the flywheel should remain relatively the same throughout years, but the projectile motion formula will vary based upon the year.

If by some horrific chance we have no one on software who knows calc, try getting someone else from the team who can draft the physics equations for us, it's not like our coach is a physics teacher.

You *should* be factoring in air resistance to get the most optimal trajectories, but if no one knows how to, then ignoring it should be ok. If you know how to do it though, be sure to factor it in.
