# Proximity Sensors

Proximity Sensors are an incredibly important set of sensors. Their job is to act as a switch to detect when something comes in range of the robot. There are many types of proximity switches, but we'll cover two common types:

Limit Switches are switches which activate when the button on them trigger from contact. They are especially useful when using a simple method to detect if an item has come in the path of the robot. You may see them used to prevent a motor from overextending.

Photoelectric switches are incredibly different from the former due to the fact they are contactless. Their job is to detect changes in light and tell the robot if the light levels pass a certain threshold.
