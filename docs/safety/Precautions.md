# Some safety precautions we take:
- Everything is below 48 volts to avoid fire hazards
- We are cautious of daisy chaining
- Everyone has to go through a mandatory safety training in the beginning of the year
- Accident reports are reviewed monthly
- We give battery spill kits and battery carriers to all teams; SAFETY SHOULD BE SHARED
- Educate every team we encounter about safety
- We have designed areas so we are away from the public in school events; do not stray away from our hallway unnecessarily
- We have breaks in between long building sessions namely on Fri and Sat for people to eat which also cares for mental health
- We mandate that everybody obtains a safety awareness badge through our UL sponsor
- We want to make the pit clean and organized to reduce any potential threats

## How YOU keep yourself safe:
- ALWAYS have safety glasses when behind the yellow line in the robot room, when near an operating robot or other moving parts, and when around the pit during competitions; if you have to ask if it should go on, put it on
- No eating drinking 
- No running or horseplay in the robot room or the pit 

### Dress code:
- No: shorts, open-toed shoes, jewelry, loose hair, loose clothing, other dangling articles
- Always notify mentors about every minor or major injury
- Fill out or have the safety captain fill out accident form
