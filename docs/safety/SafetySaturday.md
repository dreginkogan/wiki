# SAFETY SATURDAY

[Safety Slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g8mlsb3K9MKYTZI6F9kqDqxrG8BJum4SRQQ2DSUbaLQ/edit?usp=sharing)

- Some build leaders may teach new build members how some machines work
- All members, new and old, must attend a Saturday or else you won’t be allowed to handle pretty much anything in the robot room
- After the powerpoint, you will be shown where exactly the safety equipment will be for the entire year 
- The first aid kit by the 3d printers, the fire extinguisher by the door, the batteries and their holding area & straps, the battery spill kits, and your new best friend, the safety glasses closet
- Some techniques like heat shrinking and soldering might be taught
- THERE WILL BE A QUIZ AND YOU WILL FAIL IF YOU DON’T PAY ATTENTION
- That said, this isn’t just to memorize so you can get on the team; every now and then, remind yourself, “ok, that’s where the fire extinguisher is.”
