# Safety Boards and Pictures
- Safety boards were the boards above the computers in the robotics room
- Pictures will be taken in the beginning of the year
- This job will possibly be given to creative arts, but they are a part of the old instructions for safety
- When your picture is taken, you must be wearing only the robotics shirt
- Pictures will likely be taken at the invitational like last year, so make sure you are there
