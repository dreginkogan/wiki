# Battery Spills
- Battery spills are the most common accidents at competitions, and battery acid can be highly toxic if not treated properly
- Team 3624 believes “safety should be shared” as we hand out battery spill kits and battery straps to other teams during competitions
- To prevent a spill, always use battery straps when available

## Battery Spill Kit Contents List
- 8 oz. box of Arm & Hammer baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)
- 2 bandages
- 2 hair ties
- 1 pair of gloves
- 2 pairs of earplugs
- 2 alcohol wipes
- - 2 hand sanitizer wipes
- 1 quart size Ziploc bag

## What to do in the event of a Battery Spill: 
**(instructions are inside kits, but you need to act quickly)**
1. Neutralize the acid by pouring sodium bicarbonate/Arm & Hammer baking soda on all wet surfaces. The baking soda itself is not dangerous and will be disposed of in a conventional manner such as rinsing with water
2. Follow the emergency handling instructions of the SDS and notify Mentor
3. Put on gloves before handling battery
4. Place the battery in a leak-proof container for removal
5. Be sure to neutralize any acid on the gloves before removing and storing them
6. Seek medical attention if skin came into contact with any chemicals
7. Properly dispose of the battery in a plastic bag
**Additionally, if at a FIRST event:**
- Immediately send all people in contact with acid to the First Aid Station/EMT’s
- Report incident to the Pit Administration Supervisor so that the individual can fill out a Medical Incident Report Form. Provide team number and available information
- All members can help make battery spill kits; if you’re standing around doing nothing, be prepared to be pulled aside
