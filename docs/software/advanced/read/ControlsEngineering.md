# Controls Engineering

[Controls Engineering PDF](https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf)

This is probably one of the most comprehensive books for programming an FRC robot at a highly advanced level, and this book is probably one of the greatest FRC resources created. I haven't read this book yet, but based off the chapters alone I can tell it'll be useful.

Basically, it's covering all the math/physics stuff which can elevate our programming, and provides methods as to how to do it. This is not recommended for anyone who isn't in precalc/calculus or anyone who would rather be dead than read about math/physics and their applications. Yes. I get it. It's nerd crap *But it's useful nerd crap*

Hopefully I'll make a Kyle esque summary of the book's main points whenever I get around to reading through it
