# Competition Version

Both Kyle and I (Haadi) want to have a competition version along with a teaching version for the wiki. While the regular wiki is great for new members on the team, and helps grant basic knowledge for the topics, it's not really useful when we're in build season and everyone knows the basics already. This version serves more to be budget documentation to help us speed up referencing past solutions. This version will primarily just be code snippets from old robots and copy pastes from documentation, so don't expect to learn from this guide.
