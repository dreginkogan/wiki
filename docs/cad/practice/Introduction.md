# Introduction

Once you learn the basics of Fusion, we will have you do some practice to not only improve your proficiency and speed, but also to teach you some neat shortcuts and time savers to help you CAD better.

First, start off with [2D practice](https://cadin360.com/autocad-2d-exercises/). From there, you can move on to [3D practice](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/Autodesk%20Inventor%20Practice%20Part%20Drawings.pdf). Once you are experienced, you can start more robot oriented practice, and start designing new modules. Along with all of this training, we will teach you how to use our 3D printers, and do some measuring practice with calipers.
