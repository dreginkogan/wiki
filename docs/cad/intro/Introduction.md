# What is CAD?

CAD, or Computer Aided Design focuses on sketching and 3D modeling our robot, and the several components and modules that go along with it, which are then manufactured by our build team.

We work with the build team to come up with ideas for the robot, and once we can agree on that idea, it's our job to sketch it, model it, and then help the build team fabricate it.

Oftentimes all of the innovation and convenient designs come from the CAD team, as we brainstorm ideas and create prototypes to test them. Most of our prototypes are 3D printed, and once we finalize those designs, we put them onto the robot.

We have a very heavy emphasis on 3D printing, and making sure all the members of our team are able to work with our printers proficiently. We also emphasize the ability to CAD quickly by doing a lot of 2D and 3D practice, to ensure we are the best division of the team.

Joining the CAD team is a large commitment during the build season, as our members need to work side by side with our builders to ensure they are following our designs and plans. We do have fun though, and enjoy our work.
