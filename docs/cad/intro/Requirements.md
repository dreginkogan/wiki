# Requirements

You do not need to have a personal laptop in order to join the team, or have any prior experience with CAD. If you do not have a laptop, we have PCs in the Robotics room to facilitate your CADding adventures.

If you do want to use a personal laptop, try not to skimp on a laptop, and try to invest in something decent for your personal use. Running a CAD program like Fusion isn't the easiest thing in the world, so try to buy something decent if you want to have a personal laptop.
