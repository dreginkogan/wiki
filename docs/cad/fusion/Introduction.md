# Introduction

We use Fusion 360 for all of our work in CAD. We hold workshops throughout the year to get people familiar with the software, and then move on to 2D and 3D practice, and then finally practice with actual robot parts. As students, Autodesk offers free licenses to us.

First, create and Autodesk account, then download Fusion through this [link](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual). Through this [link](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/customer-service/account-management/autodesk-for-education/students-and-educators/get-started-for-students-and-educators#confirm-eligibility) you can apply for your student liscence by submitting a photo of your Student ID. Now youâ€™re all set to start CADding!
