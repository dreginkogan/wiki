# Workspaces
You will really only like this if you use VSCode for things other than robotics.

What I think is the most important feature to you is how you can enable and disable extensions for specific workspaces. I have all of my extensions disabled by default. If I open my Robotics workspace, my java and WPILib extensions are enabled. If I open my Python workspace, my python extensions are enabled. If I open my web dev workspace, my HTML, CSS, JS, TS, PHP, YAML, ect extensions are enabled.
