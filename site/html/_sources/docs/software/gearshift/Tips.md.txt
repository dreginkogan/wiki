## Tips

**DO NOT BE CONFINED TO THE WIKI**- this lesson is just a guide for learning about the software aspects of gear shifting.<br />
This is not a rulebook that you *must* be absolutely confined to this, I'm guilty of doing this as well.<br />
Different situations need different implementations of code- **not one implementation** is always going to work! <br />
I know that this has been/will be mentioned on your time on software- it is still **important to realize**.

**ASK HARDWARE FOR HELP**- Face it, most of us on software don't know the difference between a nut and a bolt, less so than an entire gear shift system.<br />
Hardware isn't your enemy or anything, ask them for help! This can be crucial when understanding how a robot's gear shift works.

**CHECK PRESSURE IN COMPRESSOR**- sometimes the solenoid won't move like the way you want it to. This doesn't mean that it is your code is the problem (still check it anyway).<br />
Sometimes the compressor is not creating enough pressure for the solenoid to move- check out the wired connections to make sure it is properly working.

**USE PROPER NAMING**- make sure that you properly name your gears in the code (normal gear when drivine- driveGear, gear used when on defense- defenseDrive, etc).<br /> 
Don't use names that don't tell the programmer anything (like g)- makes it harder to debug.
