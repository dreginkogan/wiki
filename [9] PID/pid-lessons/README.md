These lessons primarily are a text summary of the PID series by Matlab and serve to inform our team members on PID Control.
If you have any questions on a specific lesson, go to the corresponding video number in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08pQBgjxYFXSsODEF3Jqmm-y).

These notes are best read alongside the videos, acting as supplemental notes to help you focus on the important details, but I am aware that the majority of people will just read the notes and nothing more. If you want to gain as much as possible from these notes, it's best to watch the videos alongside, but if you choose not to it's up to you.

Note: These are more for understanding how this control system functions, and less so implementation. There will be no code examples through these files, moreso to understand the theory and how each part works so it is easier to figure out how to optimize and tune our systems for the robot.
