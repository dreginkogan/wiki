# Drive Types

While Differential Drive is by far our most popular drive type, we sometimes opt to use a different method of driving for our robot. The most notable (and most destructive to the cafeteria floors...) is MecanumDrive, seen most recently on 2015's Aerial Assist robot. We will cover these alternative types in this file.

## Mecanum Drive

Will tackle this later in the year, more important to cover other aspects of our wiki first. In the event no one ever actually updated this (which is more than possible lol) here's the [Aerial Assist Code](https://github.com/frc3624/aerial-assist) as well as the [official docs](https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/beta/docs/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/drive/MecanumDrive.html).
